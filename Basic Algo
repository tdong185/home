In Spring 2018, I took NYU's Basic Algorithms course.

Topics Covered:
* Recurrence equations and divide & conquer
* Sorting and Searching
* Probabilistic algorithms
* Hashing
* Balanced trees
* Graph algorithms (DFS, path problems, MST; using reductions for algorithm design)
* Dynamic programming
* Greedy algorithms
* Amortized analysis
