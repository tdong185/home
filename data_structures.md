In Fall 2017, I took NYU's Data Structures course.

<p><a href="https://joannakl.github.io/cs102_f17/index.html">Class Description:</a></p>

Use and design data structures (such as stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, hashmaps), implement them in a high-level language such as Java, and analyze their effect on algorithm efficiency.

<p><a href="https://joannakl.github.io/cs102_f17/hwk/project1.pdf">Project 1:</a> Provide a tool for converting color values from their hexadecimal representation to the RGB and name equivalents. 

  Objectives include: 
  * working with multi-file programs
  * reading data from input files
  * using and understanding command line arguments
  * using the ArrayList class
  * writing classes
  * working with existing code
  * extending existing classes (inheritance)
  * using and understanding exception handling
