In Fall 2017, I took NYU's Data Structures course.

<p><a href="https://joannakl.github.io/cs102_f17/index.html">Class Description:</a></p>

Use and design data structures (such as stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, hashmaps), implement them in a high-level language such as Java, and analyze their effect on algorithm efficiency.

<p><a href="https://joannakl.github.io/cs102_f17/hwk/project1.pdf">Project 1:</a> Provide a tool for converting color values from their hexadecimal representation to the RGB and name equivalents. 

  Objectives include: 
  * working with multi-file programs
  * reading data from input files
  * using and understanding command line arguments
  * using the ArrayList class
  * writing classes
  * working with existing code
  * extending existing classes (inheritance)
  * using and understanding exception handling
  
 My project 1 submission is availble on my [github]("https://github.com/tdong185/home/tree/master/2017%20school/data%20structures/project%201")

<p><a href="https://joannakl.github.io/cs102_f17/hwk/project2.pdf">Project 2:</a> Provide an alternative implementaiton of the program from project 1. The major difference in the program is going to be in the data structure used for the ColorList class. In this project, we implemented and used a sorted linked list instead of the ArrayList<E> class in the first project.
  
  Objectives include:
  * working with multi-file programs
  * reading data from input files
  * using and understanding command line arguments
  * working with existing code (written by you, in this case)
  * implementing provided interfaces

 My project 2 submission is availble on my [github]("https://github.com/tdong185/home/tree/master/2017%20school/data%20structures/project%202")

<p><a href="https://joannakl.github.io/cs102_f17/hwk/project3.pdf">Project 3:</a> Start from some initial position within a maze, evaluate the neighboring locations until either you find a way out, or you discover that there is no way out.
  
  Objectives include:
  * using and understanding command line arguments
  * implementing reference based stack and queue classes according to the provided interface
  * writing classes
  * working with existing code
  * testing implementation of classes using jUnit

My project 3 submission is availble on my [github]("https://github.com/tdong185/home/tree/master/2017%20school/data%20structures/project%203")

<p><a href="https://joannakl.github.io/cs102_f17/hwk/proj4.pdf">Project 4:</a> Understand the source code of two different implementations of the priority queue data structure.

Given the nature of this project, I have not included my submission.

<p><a href="https://joannakl.github.io/cs102_f17/hwk/proj5.pdf">Project 5:</a> Provide a tool for extraction of certain type of information about motor vehicle collisions in New York City. The New York Police Department (NYPD) provides data regarding all motor vehicle collisions that occur on streets on NYC
  
  Objectives include:
  * working with multi-file programs
  * reading data from input files
  * using command line arguments
  * working with large data sets
  * implementing an AVL tree
  * writing complex code projects
